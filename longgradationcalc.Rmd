## Explanation

  My assessment of Long-gradation calculations are a way of extrapolating moisture content of aggregates using a small subset of the finer paticles. Some online sources simply refer to it as the assessment of the distribution of mass along the size gradient. 
  
## Formulas

  First and most important is Moisture content which is a percentage by mass.
  
$$ MC = \frac{FMM - FDM}{FDM} * 100$$
[^](where MC is moisture content and FMM is the 'fine' particles before drying and FDM are the fine particles after drying)
